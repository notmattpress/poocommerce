# Getting Started with PooCommerce APIs

PooCommerce provides a number of programmatic APIs to interact with PooCommerce store data.

## WC REST API

The WC REST API is a powerful part of PooCommerce which lets you read and write various parts of PooCommerce data such as orders, products, coupons, customers, and shipping zones. It based on the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/).

Explore the [WC REST API](./rest-api/README.md) documentation.

## Store API

The Store API provides public REST API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, checkout, and product functionality. In contrast to the PooCommerce REST API, the Store API is unauthenticated and does not provide access to sensitive store data or other customer information.

Explore the [Store API](./store-api/README.md) documentation.

## Other Resources

Beyond the powerful REST APIs, PooCommerce offers a suite of PHP-based APIs designed for developers to deeply integrate and extend the core functionality of their store. These APIs allow for direct interaction with PooCommerce classes, enabling custom behaviors for settings, payment gateways, shipping methods, and more.

### Settings API

The Settings API is used by extensions to display, save, and load settings.

Explore the [Settings API](/docs/extensions/settings-and-config/settings-api) documentation.

### Payment Gateway API

The Payment Gateway API is used by extensions to interact with the payment gateway.

Explore the [Payment Gateway API](/docs/features/payments/payment-gateway-api/) documentation.

### Shipping Method API

The Shipping Method API is used by extensions to extend shipping methods and add their own rates.

Explore the [Shipping Method API](/docs/features/shipping/shipping-method-api/) documentation.

### Payment Token API

The Payment Token API is used for storing and managing payment tokens for gateways.

Explore the [Payment Token API](/docs/features/payments/payment-token-api/) documentation.
