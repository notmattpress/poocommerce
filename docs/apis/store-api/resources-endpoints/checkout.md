# Checkout API 

The checkout API facilitates the creation of orders (from the current cart) and handling payments for payment methods.

All checkout endpoints require either a [Nonce Token](/docs/apis/store-api/nonce-tokens) or a [Cart Token](/docs/apis/store-api/cart-tokens) otherwise these endpoints will return an error.

## Get Checkout Data

Returns data required for the checkout. This includes a draft order (created from the current cart) and customer billing and shipping addresses. The payment information will be empty, as it's only persisted when the order gets updated via POST requests (right before payment processing).

```http
GET /wc/store/v1/checkout
```

There are no parameters required for this endpoint.

```sh
curl --header "Nonce: 12345" --request GET https://example-store.com/wp-json/wc/store/v1/checkout
```

## Update checkout data

This endpoint allows you to update the checkout data for the current order. This can be called from the frontend to persist checkout fields, for example.

```http
PUT /wc/store/v1/checkout?__experimental_calc_totals=true
```

Note the `__experimental_calc_totals` parameter. This is used to determine if the cart totals should be recalculated. This should be set to true if the cart totals are being updated in response to a PUT request, false otherwise.

## Payment Data

There are many payment gateways available for merchants to use, and each one will be expecting different `payment_data`. We cannot comprehensively list all expected requests for all payment gateways, and we would recommend reaching out to the authors of the payment gateway plugins you're working with for further information.

An example of the payment data sent to the Checkout endpoint when using the [PooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway](https://wordpress.org/plugins/poocommerce-gateway-stripe/) is shown below.

For further information on generating a `stripe_source` please check [the Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs).

```json
{
  "payment_data": [
    {
      "key": "stripe_source",
      "value": "src_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    },
    {
      "key": "billing_email",
      "value": "myemail@email.com"
    },
    {
      "key": "billing_first_name",
      "value": "Jane"
    },
    {
      "key": "billing_last_name",
      "value": "Doe"
    },
    {
      "key": "paymentMethod",
      "value": "stripe"
    },
    {
      "key": "paymentRequestType",
      "value": "cc"
    },
    {
      "key": "wc-stripe-new-payment-method",
      "value": true
    }
  ]
}
```
