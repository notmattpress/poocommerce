# Developer tools

This guide provides an overview of essential tools and libraries for PooCommerce development. It's intended for developers looking to enhance their PooCommerce projects efficiently.

## Productivity Tools

Use these resources to power up your PooCommerce development workflows.

### Development

#### [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/)

This is the command-line interface for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). You can update plugins, configure multisite installations and much more, without using a web browser.

#### [wc-cli](/docs/wc-cli/cli-overview)

When PooCommerce is running on a WordPress installation, the WP-CLI is extended with additional functionality for managing your store data.

#### [wp-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env)

This command-line tool lets you easily set up a local WordPress Docker environment for building and testing plugins and themes. It's simple to install and requires no configuration.

#### [poocommerce/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@poocommerce/eslint-plugin)

This is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin including configurations and custom rules for PooCommerce development.

#### [WordPress Scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts)

The ‚Å†@wordpress/scripts package is a set of tools and scripts designed to streamline the development process of WordPress projects, particularly for block development and custom Gutenberg integrations. It includes a Webpack build process along with configuration for tasks like linting, styling, and testing.

It also includes the [Dependency Extraction Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin), which allows JavaScript bundles produced by webpack to leverage WordPress style dependency sharing without an error-prone process of manually maintaining a dependency list.

### Testing

#### [Smooth Generator](https://github.com/poocommerce/wc-smooth-generator)

A plugin to help you generate PooCommerce-related data for testing. Use the WP Admin interface for basic operations, or the CLI tool for more advanced features. Download and install the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/poocommerce/wc-smooth-generator/releases) and review the [documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/poocommerce/wc-smooth-generator).

#### [PooCommerce Dummy Payments Gateway](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce-gateway-dummy)

A dummy payment gateway for your PooCommerce development needs, with built-in support for subscriptions and the block-based checkout.

#### [QIT](https://qit.woo.com/)

QIT is a testing platform for PooCommerce plugins and themes with managed tests, E2E tests, and disposable local testing environments.

## Libraries

Use these resources to help take some of the heavy lifting off of fetching and transforming data \-- as well as creating UI elements.

### API Clients

#### [PooCommerce REST API - JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@poocommerce/poocommerce-rest-api)

The official JavaScript library for working with the PooCommerce REST API.

#### [PooCommerce Store API](https://developer.poocommerce.com/docs/category/store-api/)

The Store API provides public Rest API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, checkout, and product functionality. It follows many of the patterns used in the WordPress REST API.

In contrast to the PooCommerce REST API, the Store API is unauthenticated and does not provide access to sensitive store data or other customer information.

#### [wordpress/api-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/api-fetch)

The `@wordpress/api-fetch` package is a utility that simplifies AJAX requests to the WordPress REST API. It's a wrapper around `window.fetch` that provides a consistent interface for handling authentication, settings, and errors, allowing developers to easily interact with WordPress backend services.
