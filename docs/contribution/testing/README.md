# Testing

Properly setting up your test environment and writing tests when contributing to PooCommerce core are essential parts of our development pipeline. The links below are also included in our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.

If you have any questions about testing please reach out to the developer community in our public channels([Developer Blog](https://developer.poocommerce.com/blog/), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/discussions), or [Community Slack](https://poocommerce.com/community-slack/)).

## Unit Testing

[End-to-end tests](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/poocommerce/tests/e2e-pw) are powered by `Playwright`. The test site is spun up using `wp-env` ([recommended](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/)). 

## API Testing

[API tests](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/poocommerce/tests/e2e-pw/tests/api-tests) are based on `Playwright` and `wp-env`.

## Calls for Testing
