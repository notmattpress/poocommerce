# PooCommerce Git Flow

## Conventions

### Branch Naming

While we don't enforce any naming conventions except for release branches (which always start with `release/`), prefixes help indicate the type of branch or change they refer to. Some common prefixes include `fix/`, `feature/`, `add/`, and `update/`.

In particular, when creating a **fix branch**, use the correct prefix and the issue number (e.g., `fix/12345`) or summarize the change (e.g., `fix/12345-shipping-tax-rate-saving`).

## Releases

For core development, we use the following structure and flow.

Refer to the [release schedule](/docs/contribution/releases/schedule) document for more details.
