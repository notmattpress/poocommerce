# Release Workflows

The PooCommerce release process is supported by a set of GitHub Actions workflows that automate repetitive tasks, enforce process guardrails, and send notifications. This page provides a reference of all release-related workflows, organized by how they are triggered.

All workflows are defined in the [`.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/tree/trunk/.github/workflows) directory.

## Scheduled workflows

These workflows run automatically on a daily schedule.

| Workflow | Schedule | What it does | When it acts |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| [Release: Assignment](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/release-assignment.yml) | Daily at 18:00 UTC | Checks the [release calendar](https://developer.poocommerce.com/release-calendar/), assigns the release lead, and creates the parent tracking issue with sub-issues for each release in the cycle. Calls *Create Tracking Issue* for each sub-issue. | ~8 weeks before feature freeze. |
| [Release: Enforce Feature Freeze](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/release-code-freeze.yml) | Daily at 18:00 UTC | Checks the [release calendar](https://developer.poocommerce.com/release-calendar/) and creates the release branch from `trunk`, bumps `trunk` to the next dev version, publishes a dev release, cleans up old milestones, and sends Slack notifications. Calls *Bump version number* and *Build ZIP file*. | On the feature freeze date. |
| [Release: Feature highlight notification](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/release-feature-highlights-notification.yml) | Daily at 09:00 UTC | Checks the [release calendar](https://developer.poocommerce.com/release-calendar/) and sends a Slack reminder to teams about the upcoming feature freeze deadline. | ~1 week before feature freeze. |
| [Release: Open Issue Warning](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/release-open-issue-warning.yml) | Daily at 18:00 UTC | Checks the [release calendar](https://developer.poocommerce.com/release-calendar/) and looks for open items in release milestones, sending a Slack notification listing them with assignees. | Within 72 hours of a release date. |
| [Nightly builds](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/nightly-builds.yml) | Daily at 00:00 UTC | Builds a nightly ZIP from `trunk` and uploads it to a GitHub release. Runs every day, independent of the release calendar. | Every day. |

## Event-driven workflows

These workflows are triggered automatically by GitHub events such as pull requests being merged, releases being published, or issues being labeled.

### Cherry-pick and backport

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| [Cherry-pick Milestoned PRs to Release Branches](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/cherry-pick-milestoned-prs.yml) | PR closed or milestoned on `trunk` | Cherry-picks from `trunk` to the `release/x.y` branch matching the PR milestone. Uses [`shared-cherry-pick`](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/shared-cherry-pick.yml) for the core logic. |
| [Cherry-pick to Frozen Release](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/cherry-pick-to-frozen.yml) | PR merged on a `release/x.y` branch with the `cherry pick to frozen release` label | Cherry-picks from a `release/x.y` branch to the next (frozen) `release/x.y` branch. Uses [`shared-cherry-pick`](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/shared-cherry-pick.yml) for the core logic. |
| [Cherry Pick to Trunk](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/cherry-pick-to-trunk.yml) | PR merged on a `release/x.y` branch with the `cherry pick to trunk` label | Cherry-picks from a `release/x.y` branch back to `trunk`. Uses [`shared-cherry-pick`](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/shared-cherry-pick.yml) for the core logic. |
| [Block merge if cherry-pick conflicts exist](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/release-cherry-pick-pr-check-conflicts.yml) | PR events on `cherry-pick-*` branches | Fails CI when the `cherry pick has conflicts` label is present, preventing the PR from being merged until conflicts are resolved and the label is removed. |
