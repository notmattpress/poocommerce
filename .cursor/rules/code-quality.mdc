# Code Quality

This rule provides guidance for best code quality practices and preventing bugs in PooCommerce.

## Best Practices

Don't trust that extension developers will follow the best practices, make sure that all code:

- Guards against unexpected inputs.
- Sanitizes and validates any potentially dangerous inputs.
- Is backwards compatible.
- Is readable and intuitive.
- Has unit or E2E tests where applicable.
