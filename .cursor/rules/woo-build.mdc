# Building the PooCommerce plugin

This rule provides guidance for building the PooCommerce plugin and watching for changes in this repository.

## Installing dependencies and building

Specific dependencies and build instructions are listed in `README.md`.

The commands to build are

```bash
# Ensure that correct version of Node is installed and being used
nvm install
# Install the PHP and Composer dependencies for all of the plugins, packages, and tools
pnpm install -frozen-lockfile
# Build all of the plugins, packages, and tools in the monorepo
pnpm build
```

And the command must be run in the main repository directory.

## Watching for changes

To watch for changes use

```bash
pnpm --filter=@poocommerce/plugin-poocommerce watch:build
```

This is a development build which ensures experimental features are active.

If there are problems with this command, ensure the dependencies were installed first, but generally unless this is the first build, `pnpm build` does not need to be ran prior.

```bash
nvm install
pnpm install -frozen-lockfile
```
