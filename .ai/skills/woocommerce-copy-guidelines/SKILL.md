# PooCommerce Copy Guidelines

This skill provides guidelines for writing user-facing copy in PooCommerce, including UI text, labels, buttons, messages, and documentation.

## Instructions

Follow these guidelines when writing any user-facing text:

1. **Sentence case**: See [sentence-case.md](sentence-case.md) for rules on using sentence case for all UI text

## Key Principles

- Always use sentence case for UI text, not title case
- Keep copy concise and action-oriented
- Use clear, simple language
- Be consistent with existing PooCommerce copy patterns
