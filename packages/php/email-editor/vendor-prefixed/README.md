# PooCommerce Email Editor Vendor-Prefixed Dependencies

This directory contains vendor-prefixed dependencies for the PooCommerce Email Editor package to avoid conflicts with other plugins that might include the same packages.

## What is this directory?

The directory content is automatically generated by the Mozart tool and contains prefixed versions of third-party dependencies. The contents of the `packages` and `classes` directories are automatically generated during `composer install` and `composer update`.

## Key Features

- **Namespace Prefixing**: All namespaces are prefixed with `Automattic\PooCommerce\EmailEditorVendor\`
- **Classmap Prefixing**: Classmap classes are prefixed with `EmailEditorVendor_`
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Prevents conflicts with plugins that include the same packages
- **Automatic Generation**: Contents are automatically managed by Mozart

## Current Dependencies

- **pelago/emogrifier** (v7.3.0): CSS inlining library for email HTML processing

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not make direct changes to files in the `packages` or `classes` directories!** Any manual changes will be lost when the dependencies are regenerated.

## How it Works

1. Dependencies are defined in `composer.json` under `require-dev`
2. Mozart configuration in `composer.json` specifies prefixing rules
3. During `composer install/update`, Mozart automatically:
   - Downloads the original packages
   - Prefixes namespaces and class names
   - Generates the prefixed versions in this directory
   - Cleans up the original vendor directories

## Mozart Configuration

The Mozart configuration in `composer.json` includes:

- **dep_namespace**: `Automattic\PooCommerce\EmailEditorVendor\`
- **dep_directory**: `/packages/`
- **classmap_directory**: `/classes/`
- **classmap_prefix**: `EmailEditorVendor_`
- **delete_vendor_directories**: `true`

## Usage

The prefixed dependencies are automatically loaded through the main package's autoloader. You don't need to interact with this directory directly - use the dependencies through their prefixed namespaces in your code.

## Adding new package

* Add a new package as a dev dependency e.g, `composer require PACKAGE_NAME --dev`
* Run composer install from email editor PHP package root e.g, `composer install`

## Related Files
