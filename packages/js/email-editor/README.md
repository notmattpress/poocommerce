# PooCommerce Email Editor

This is the PooCommerce Email Editor package - a JavaScript library for building and customizing email templates. While currently integrated with PooCommerce, this package is designed to be used as an independent library in other projects.

You can try the email editor in [the WordPress Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/refs/heads/trunk/packages/js/email-editor/blueprint.json).

This JavaScript package is designed to work in conjunction with its PHP counterpart, which can be found in the same repository at `packages/php/email-editor`. Both packages are required for full functionality.

## Initializing the editor

> **Note:** The `initializeEditor` function is currently experimental and its API is subject to change in future releases. Please be aware that breaking changes may occur.

To use the email editor in your project, you'll need to initialize it using the `initializeEditor` function. The editor requires certain data to be set on the global `window.PooCommerceEmailEditor` object before initialization:

```javascript
// First, set up the required data on the window object
window.PooCommerceEmailEditor = {
    current_post_type: '', // The post type of the current post
    current_post_id: '', // The ID of the current post
    current_wp_user_email: '', // The email of the current user
    editor_settings: {}, // The block editor settings
    editor_theme: {}, // The block editor theme
    user_theme_post_id: '', // The ID of the user theme post
    urls: {
        listings: '', // optional: The URL for the listings page
        send: '', // optional: The URL for the send button
        back: '', // optional: The URL for the back button (top left corner)
    },
};

// Then initialize the editor with the HTML element ID
import { initializeEditor } from '@poocommerce/email-editor';
initializeEditor( 'email-editor-container' );
```

The `initializeEditor` function accepts a single parameter:

-   `htmlId` (required): The ID of the HTML element where the editor will be mounted

Make sure to set up the required data on `window.PooCommerceEmailEditor` before calling `initializeEditor`.

## Workflow Commands

We use `pnpm` run scripts to run the commands. You can run them using `pnpm run <command>`.
Please start with `pnpm install`.

```bash
pnpm run build                              # runs the build command
pnpm run start                              # starts the webpack development server
pnpm run lint:css                           # runs stylelint on all .scss files
pnpm run lint:css-fix                       # fixes errors reported by `pnpm run lint:css`
pnpm run lint:js                            # runs eslint on all js and ts files (including the .jsx and .tsx versions)
pnpm run lint:js-fix                        # fixes errors reported by `pnpm run lint:js`
pnpm run lint:lang:types                    # runs type check on all typescript files
pnpm run format                             # runs prettier on files. This uses WordPress coding standards.
pnpm run test:js                            # runs JS component test using Jest
```

## Development

### Main parts

**Email Editor** – JS application. Custom editor built with WordPress (`@wordpress`) JS packages. Most important ones are `@wordpress/block-editor`, `@wordpress/editor`, `@wordpress/data` and `@wordpress/components`. There is also some PHP code to bootstrap the editor.
**Storage** – we store email content as custom post-type + we use templates (a couple of dummy hardcoded templates) to carry shared parts of the content (header, footer) and style settings. Currently, we store complete style settings per template.
**Renderer** – responsible for converting saved HTML from Gutenberg editor to HTML for email clients.
**Theme Controller** – The theme controller is used to generate settings and styles for the editor. We can define which features for working with content are available in settings. The styles are also used in the Render.

### Dependencies

#### Rich-text

The **Personalization tags** feature relies on the `@wordpress/rich-text` package, which is included in both the Gutenberg plugin and WordPress core.
To ensure the correct functionality of the Email Editor and its features, you must use **at least version 7.14.0** of the `@wordpress/rich-text` package.
The required minimum version of this package is stored in the assets directory.
If your WordPress installation does not use the Gutenberg plugin or does not include the required version, replace the existing `@wordpress/rich-text` package with the one provided in the assets directory.

### Email Editor

-   Bootstrapped in the plugin in the [email editor controller](https://github.com/mailpoet/mailpoet/blob/13bf305aeb29bbadd0695ee02a3735e62cc4f21f/mailpoet/lib/EmailEditor/Integrations/MailPoet/EmailEditor.php)
-   **Components folder** - basically the whole UI of the editor. Most of Gutenberg's blocks magic happens in block-editor folder.
-   **Hooks folder** – several custom hooks mostly to help us pass around data and process data from the store or combine them from multiple stores.
-   **Store folder** – classic `wordpress/data` store. We try to use stores from packages we build on as much as possible, but sometimes we need to add an action etc.
-   **Layouts folder** – contains one layout. Gutenberg support flex, grid but these can't be used because email clients don't support them. Flex-email is restricted layout that supports some features from flex. It is used for buttons.
-   **Blocks folder** – when we add support for block, we usually need to do some adjustments and hide some styling options. This is done via Blocks API and save in this folder.
-   **Lock-unlock** – key to open the Pandora box with private components from WP packages
-   **.sccs files** – we don't write much CSS. We load styles for the post editor (this is done in page controller) but sometimes we need some adjustments of have a custom ui
-   **Custom blocks** - MailPoet custom blocks should be built in [mailpoet-custom-email-editor-blocks folder](https://github.com/mailpoet/mailpoet/tree/13bf305aeb29bbadd0695ee02a3735e62cc4f21f/mailpoet/assets/js/src/mailpoet-custom-email-editor-blocks)
