# ExPlat

This packages includes a component and utility functions that can be used to run A/B Tests in PooCommerce dashboard, report pages, and frontend pages.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
pnpm install @poocommerce/explat --save
```

This package assumes that your code will run in an ES2015+ environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using core-js or @babel/polyfill will add support for these methods. Learn more about it in Babel docs.

import { Experiment } from '@poocommerce/explat';

const DefaultExperience = <div>Hello World</div>;

const TreatmentExperience = <div>Hello PooCommerce!</div>;

const LoadingExperience = <div>‚è∞</div>;

<Experiment
	name="poocommerce_example_experiment"
	defaultExperience={ DefaultExperience }
	treatmentExperience={ TreatmentExperience }
	loadingExperience={ LoadingExperience }

<ExperimentWithAuth
	name="poocommerce_example_experiment"
	defaultExperience={ DefaultExperience }
