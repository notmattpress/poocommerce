## Feature plugin and package inclusion in PooCommerce

### Prevent unnecessarily showing the item names in a shipping package if it's the only package. ([6899](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce-blocks/pull/6899))

1. Set up shipping zones so you have multiple methods for your country (flat rate and free is fine) and a single method for a different country.
2. Install the ["Multiple Packages for PooCommerce" plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multiple-packages-for-poocommerce/)
3. Navigate to PooCommerce -> Settings -> Multiple Packages
4. Adjust the settings to work based on "Per Product"
5. Add two items that require shipping to your cart.
6. Go to the Cart block. Ensure you see the item name listed under each package.
7. Remove one of the items, ensure the list of shipping options updates and does not include the item name.
8. Change your address to one that only has a single shipping method. Repeat steps 5-7.
9. Repeat 5-7 on the Checkout block too.
