### Bug Fixes

#### Update Jetpack PooCommerce Analytics module integration to check for changed template names ([#11707](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce-blocks/pull/11707))

1. Enable Jetpack and ensure the PooCommerce Analytics module is set up and enabled.
2. Install [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/).
3. Go to the Cart and Checkout blocks and ensure no PHP warnings are logged.
