## Feature plugin and package inclusion in PooCommerce

### Fix a bug in which resource hinting was breaking cart in subfolder installs. ([7211](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce-blocks/pull/7211))

1. Make sure Gutenberg is disabled.
2. Add an item to cart.
3. Go to any frontend page, and view the page source.
4. In that source page, search for scripts starting with `/wp-includes`, you shouldn't see any relative links in them, e.g. /wp-includes/js/dist/vendor/lodash.min.js, but that everything starts with a full link, e.g. <https://example.com/wp-includes/js/dist/vendor/lodash.min.js>.
