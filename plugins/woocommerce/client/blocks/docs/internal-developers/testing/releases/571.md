## Feature plugin and package inclusion in PooCommerce

### Disable Cart, Checkout, All Products & filters blocks from the widgets screen ([4646](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4646))

With Storefront and WP 5.8:

1. Go to Appearance > Widgets and verify you can't add the Cart, Checkout, All Products & filters blocks.
2. Go to Appearance > Customizer > Widgets and verify you can't add those blocks either.
3. Create a new post or page and verify those blocks can be added without problems.
