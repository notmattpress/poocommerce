# PooCommerce Store API

**The Store API provides public Rest API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, checkout, and product functionality. It follows many of the patterns used in the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/).**

In contrast to the PooCommerce REST API, the Store API is unauthenticated and does not provide access to sensitive store data or other customer information.
