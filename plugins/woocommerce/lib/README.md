# PooCommerce Lib Directory

This directory contains a dummy package responsible for managing PooCommerce dependencies that require conflict avoidance. 
The contents of the `packages` and `classes` directories get automatically generated by `composer install` and `composer update`.

This allows us to prefix namespaces and classmap classes to avoid conflicts with plugins that include the same package.
All namespaces are prefixed with `Automattic\PooCommerce\Vendor` and classmap classes prefixed with `WC_Vendor_`.

**_Do not_ make direct changes in the files contained in `packages` or `classes`! Any changes will be lost!**

## Adding Packages

In order to avoid including the original dependencies in the root autoloader we must utilize `require-dev` for them.
Composer treats `require` dependencies as transitive while `require-dev` dependencies get ignored by consumers.

1. Add package to `require-dev` section of `composer.json`
2. Add package slug to `extra/mozart/packages` section of `composer.json`
3. Run `composer run-script build-lib` from the root directory (You should now see the package in `packages/VendorName/PackageName` or `classes`)

## Updating Packages

Updating a package is as easy as changing the version in `composer.json` and then running `composer run-script build-lib` from the root directory.

## Ignoring Packages

If you would like to add a package which does not undergo conflict avoidance you must take steps to ensure it appears in
the root autoloader.

1. Add package to the `require` section of both the `lib/composer.json` and root `composer.json` file instead of `require-dev`
2. Add package slug to `extra/mozart/excluded-packages` section of `composer.json`
3. Run `composer run-script build-lib` from the root directory (You **should not** see the package in `packages/VendorName/PackageName` or `classes`) - see the note about MobileDetect below.

## A note about the MobileDetect library

The `lib/packages/Detection/MobileDetect.php` file
[got manual changes to prevent deprecation warnings in PHP 8](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/pull/53526).
These fixes are already present in newer versions of the package, but we can't update to any of these versions
because they all require PHP 8. The package version currently in use is the newest one supporting PHP 7.4.

Therefore, as long as PooCommerce runs in PHP 7.4 and no alternative solution is found for this, 
the changes in `lib/packages/Detection/MobileDetect.php` must be manually reverted after running
`composer run-script build-lib`. This can be accomplished from the command line by running
`git restore ./plugins/poocommerce/lib/packages/Detection/MobileDetect.php` from the root of the repository.
