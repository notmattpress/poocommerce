## Coding Guidelines and Development ðŸ› 

- Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/).
- Run our build process described in the document on [how to set up PooCommerce development environment](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/wiki/How-to-set-up-PooCommerce-development-environment), it will install our pre-commit hook, code sniffs, dependencies, and more.
- Before pushing commits to GitHub, check your code against our code standards. For PHP code in the PooCommerce Core project you can do this by running `pnpm --filter=@poocommerce/plugin-poocommerce lint:php:changes:branch`.
- Whenever possible, please fix pre-existing code standards errors in code that you change.
- Please consider adding appropriate tests related to your change if applicable such as unit, API and E2E tests. You can check the following guides for this purpose:
    - [Writing unit tests](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/poocommerce/tests/README.md#guide-for-writing-unit-tests).
    - [Writing API tests](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/poocommerce/tests/api-core-tests#guide-for-writing-api-tests).
    - [Writing E2E tests](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/poocommerce/tests/e2e-pw#guide-for-writing-e2e-tests).
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of PHP and WordPress; this is shown at the top of the `readme.txt` file.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the trunk branch of the PooCommerce repository.
- Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
- Please create a change file for your changes by running `pnpm --filter=<project> changelog add`. For example, a change file for the PooCommerce Core project would be added by running `pnpm --filter=@poocommerce/plugin-poocommerce changelog add`. 
- Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files. These will be updated by the PooCommerce team. 

## Feature Requests ðŸš€

The best place to submit feature requests is over on our [dedicated feature request page](https://poocommerce.com/feature-requests/poocommerce/). You can easily search and vote for existing requests, or create new requests if necessary.

Alternatively, if you wish to propose a straightforward technical enhancement that is unlikely to require much discussion, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement%2Cstatus%3A+awaiting+triage&template=2-enhancement.yml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+) right here on GitHub and, for any that may require more discussion, consider syncing with us during office hours or publishing a thread on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/poocommerce/poocommerce/discussions).
